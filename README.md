# cse403-batchable

Our product is Batchable, a real-time food delivery batching system. It works as a web application that interfaces with medium-sized restaurants, constantly checking if orders should go out as singles, doubles, or triples, using live updates about new orders, readiness, and remakes. Typically, dispatchers have to balance delivery times, food freshness, and how drivers are used–all while handling new orders, remakes, and cancellations. For medium-sized restaurants, this is inevitably done by hand, which leads to inconsistent results and avoidable delivery problems. That’s where Batchable comes in. We will handle this delicate balance for businesses, leading to simpler workflows, fewer headaches, and better resource utilization.

## Editor/Git Configuration
Please install an [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) extension/plug-in for your editor so as to use our global .editorconfig settings and not mess up spacing, indentation, or line endings. If you're on Windows, please also use Git's `autocrlf=false` option, which is likely already enabled. If it's not, you can use:
```sh
$ git config --global autocrlf false
```
Thank you!
## Frontend (Local Development)
### Prerequisites
Install node.js via the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
Once you have node installed, enter the frontend folder
```bash
cd frontend
```
Then, install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
Next, run the server:
```bash
npm run build
```
After running npm build, a folder named `build` should appear within the frontend. Copy all contents of the `build` folder, and paste it into a folder named `static`, located in backend/src/main/resources/
Now you're set up to communicate with and run the backend!

## Backend (Local Development)
### Prerequisites
Download JDK 17 [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)\
To run the backend locally:
```bash
cd backend
```
Then run the backend server
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
### Coverage
#### Prerequisites
Ensure Docker Desktop is running
`$ docker` should return docker commands
`$ export GOOGLE_API_ROUTES_KEY = "<key>"`

To run code coverage: `./mvnw verify`
Look for coverage results in `backend/target/site/jacoco/index.html`

## Database (Local Development)

We use Postgres running in Docker for local development. The database data persist via Docker and Schema/Migrations will live under infra/postgres

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop
- Node.js (for npm scripts)

### Start the database
```bash
docker compose up -d db
```

### Connect to Postgres
``` bash
npm run db:psql
```
