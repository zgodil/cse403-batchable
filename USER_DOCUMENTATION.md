# Batchable User Documentatoin

## 1. Description
Batchable is a real-time food delivery batching system designed for
medium-sized restaurants. It helps restaurant staff determine whether
orders should be dispatched individually or grouped into double or
triple batches.

Restaurant dispatching often requires balancing:
-Delivery times
-Food freshness
-Driver availability
-New incoming orders
-Remakes and cancellations

Batchable simplifies this process by automating order handling the batching process.

### Adding Menu Items
Under the Manage Restaurant tab, you can also add menu items that your restaurant offers. Just enter the name of the menu item and save it. You can also edit or remove menu items as needed to keep your menu up to date.
