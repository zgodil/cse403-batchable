/*
Data Layout
Our service stores and processes a variety of domain objects,
specifically the following, each of which has all of its fields and types specified.
These will be used as the basis of the database schema, as well as the runtime
representation throughout the system. Each model provided is implied to additionally
have a unique id, and when a model contains a member whose type is another model,
it is implied that that field will in fact reference a foreign key when placed into 
the database. Several types are left intentionally vague (like Location, DateTime, 
etc.) to avoid excessive specificity. Additionally, our database will store Auth0’s 
authentication and authorization information, whose schema we need not know.

	location: Location
